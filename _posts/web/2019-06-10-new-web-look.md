After several re-branding iterations, the xPack project, available from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/xpack), has a new web site.

## GitHub Pages

The new site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which is 
the GitHub solution for providing documentation sites to hosted projects.

## Jekyll & markdown

GitHub Pages use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate static web 
sites, and the most convenient input format for Jekyll is 
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
