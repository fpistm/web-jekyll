## Install

The full details of installing theÂ **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms are presented in the separate
[Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU Arm Embedded GCC is with
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}
```

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**{{ page.arm_version }}** release {{ page.arm_date }} and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

For more details see the original Arm release text files:

- `distro-info/arm-readme.txt`
- `distro-info/arm-release.txt`

Note: compared to the Arm distribution, the Aarch64 binaries are not yet
available.

## Supported libraries

The supported libraries are:

```console
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -print-multi-lib

## Bug fixes

- none,

## Changes

There should be no functional changes.

Compared to previous releases, the new archives are created with
a single folder named `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-9.3.1-1.1` instead of
the hierarchical `xPacks/arm-none-eabi-gcc/9.3.1-1.1`. This internal
folder name is used consistently on all platforms. The archive extension
was changed to `.tar.gz`.

With these changes, the archives can now be used directly in other
development environments (like Arduino), without having to repack them.

## Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
two separate binaries,
`arm-none-eabi-gdb-py` with Python 2.7 support, and `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for Python 3.7.

Mode details on the prerequisites of running GDB with Python support are
available from
[GDB with Python support](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/python/).

## Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

Note: TUI is not available on Windows.

## Known problems

- the GDB binaries with Python support were built with version 2.7/3.7,
 and require exactly those versions in order to run properly.

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally in the
same folder as the executable.

### `runpath`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

Please note that in the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RUNPATH` has
lower priority than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one is set
in the environment, it might interfere with the xPack binaries.

### `@executable_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the dynamic libraries are adjusted with `otool` to use a
relative path.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[How to build?](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md) page.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- Intel GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- Arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed automatically on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [Test xPack Arm Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/704528867)
- [Test xPack Arm Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/704562965)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by Arm, the
long and complex tests performed by Arm to validate their release were not
executed again.
