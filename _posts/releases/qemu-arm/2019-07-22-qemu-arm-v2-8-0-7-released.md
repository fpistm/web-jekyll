[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as 
[`@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

## Bug fixes

- [[#70](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/issues/70)] due to a bug 
  in the Windows specific part, in certain conditions, starting QEMU in
  non-graphic mode affected the GDB server functionality; thanks to a 
  contribution by GitHub user `@zaq32` 
  [[#71](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/pull/71)] the bug was fixed.
  
## Known problems

- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using 
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set 
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be 
compatible with most recent systems.

- GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6 
  Docker container
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a 
  CentOS 6 Docker container 
- macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate  
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple 
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in running a simple blinky application
on the graphically emulated STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by 
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** project.
