The full details of installing theÂ **xPack OpenOCD** on various platforms
are presented in the separate 
[Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/openocd/install/) page.

### Easy install 

The easiest way to install OpenOCD is with 
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as 
[`@xpack-dev-tools/openocd`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}
```

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

Compared to the upstream, the following changes were applied:

- a configure option was added to configure branding (`--enable-branding`)
- the `src/openocd.c` file was edited to display the branding string
- the `contrib/60-openocd.rules` file was simplified to avoid protection 
  related issues.

## Known problems

- none

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using 
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set 
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be 
compatible with most recent systems.

- GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6 
  Docker container
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a 
  CentOS 6 Docker container 
- macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate  
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple 
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in programming and debugging a simple blinky application
on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by 
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** project.
