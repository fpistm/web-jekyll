## Install

The full details of installing theÂ **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** on 
various platforms are presented in the separate 
[Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/riscv-none-embed-gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install 

The easiest way to install GNU ARM Embedded GCC is with 
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as 
[`@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}
```

## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official 
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com) 
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is similar to the SiFive 2019-05 release, including support for 
SiFive specific CLIC interrupts and a larger multilib set.

```console
$ riscv-none-embed-gcc -print-multi-lib

```

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf` 
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multilibs
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, is included 

## Known problems

- none

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using 
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set 
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be 
compatible with most recent systems.

- GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6 
  Docker container
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a 
  CentOS 6 Docker container 
- macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate  
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple 
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some 
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
