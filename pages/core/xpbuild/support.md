## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/); please select
the correct forum.

## Check the documentation

Read carefully the xpbuild [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpbuild/).

## Check the FAQ

Check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpbuild/faq/) for similar problems.

## Check the xPack forums

Check the [xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for
discussions on similar problems.

## Check the GitHub issues

Check the
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/),
and enter a **New Topic** in the **xpbuild** section.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug in **xpbuild**
(if you have doubts, use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance **xpbuild**,
register a **New Issue** in the the
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/issues/) tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the forums**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the xPack forums**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since forum posts are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
