## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/); please select
the correct forum.

## Pre-checklist

Before asking a question:

- read carefully the VS Code xPack [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/vscode/)
- check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/faq/) for similar problems
- check the [xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for
discussions on similar problems
- check the
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in the forums

If you still could not find an answer, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/),
and enter a **New Topic** in the
**xPack C/C++ Managed Build Extension** section.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug in **ilg-vscode.xpack**
extension
(if you have doubts, use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance **ilg-vscode.xpack**,
register a **New Issue** in the the
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the forums**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the xPack forums**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since forum posts are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
