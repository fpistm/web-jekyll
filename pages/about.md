## The project

The **xPack** project was got its name in 2017, but it actually originated 
in 2012, when it was named xcdl, and a Python implementation of the eCos 
CDL was written.

### Motto: _Perfekt ist nicht gut genug_

Some time ago, while watching a TV documentary about Porsche, I heard this line and I liked it. If this is indeed one of Porsche mottos, then thank you Porsche for it (and for the beautiful designs). (English: _"Perfect is not good enough"_)

## This site

The site was created in October 2017, using a home grown GitHub-like theme; 
however there was not much content for a while.

In June 2019 it was reworked to use a 
more functional theme, [Jekyll Doc Theme 6.0](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) by [Tom Johnson](https://github.com/tomjoht).
