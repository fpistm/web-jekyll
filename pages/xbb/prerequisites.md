The latest generation of the build scripts use the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
containers (separate 32/64-bit containers) based on older
and more conservative distributions, to avoid problems when
attempting to run the executables on older versions.

The XBB v3.2 uses Ubuntu 12 for Intel GNU/Linux and Ubuntu 16 for
Arm GNU/Linux.

{% include note.html content="Building Arm binaries requires
an Arm machine. A Raspberry Pi 4 8GB equiped with a SanDisk Extreme
USB 3 SSD are a good solution." %}

v2.x used CentOS 6 for Intel, and CentOS 7 was the favourite when
considering the update, but Docker CentOS 7 armv7l container does not
run on 64-bit Docker host, and requires a 32-bit host, which is impractical.
The problem was reported as 
[#171](https://github.com/CentOS/sig-cloud-instance-images/issues/171)
and posted on the CentOS
[forum](https://forums.centos.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=75475), but so far
there were no solution.

The Windows binaries are generated on the same Docker Intel GNU/Linux
containers, using [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org).

### GNU/Linux

Any GNU/Linux distribution that is able to run Docker should be ok; it
is not necessary to have a physical machine, virtual machines are
perfectly fine. For better results, dedicate 3-4 cores and 8-12 GB of RAM.

The procedure was tested on:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, running as a virtual machine in Parallels Desktop on macOS 10.12.
- Ubuntu 17.10, running as a virtual machine in VirtualBox on macOS 10.13
- Ubuntu 18.04 Server, running on an Intel NUC NUC8i7BEH with 32GB of RAM
- Debian 10 (buster), running on an Intel NUC NUC8i7BEH with 32GB of RAM
- Debian 9 (stretch), running on a ROCK Pi with 4GB of RAM
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM

The build scripts do most of the actual work in the Docker container, and,
apart from Docker, the host machine has no other special requirements.

#### Install Docker

For any GNU/Linux distribution, follow the
[specific instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

For example, the steps to install Docker on a modern 64-bit Ubuntu system are basically:

```console
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates  curl software-properties-common

$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

$ version_name=$(lsb_release -cs)
$ sudo add-apt-repository  "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  ${version_name} stable"

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce
```

{% include warning.html content="Please note that the above lines get the
current version name via `lsb_release` and assumes that a folder with that
name is available at https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/.
This is true for most versions, except the very latest one, which might not
yet be made available by the Docker team. In this case set the
`version_name`Â manually to the previous version.
You can also do this by
manually editting the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.
At the time
of writing this, the version for Ubuntu 19.10 **eoan** is not available
and you must use **disco**." %}

To check if the install is functional, run the _Hello World_ image,
for the moment as `sudo`:

```console
$ sudo docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
b04784fba78d: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f3b3b28a45160805bb16542c9531888519430e9e6d6ffc09d72261b0d26ff74f
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
...
```

#### Configure Docker to run as a regular user

To allow Docker to run as a regular user, you need to be a member of
the `docker` group.

```console
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
$ sudo service docker restart
```

The above script are for Ubuntu and the Debian family. For other
distributions, the last line may differ, for example for Arch Linux use:

```console
$ systemctl restart docker
```

To make these changes effective, preferably **reboot** the machine.

To check if the configuration change is functional, run the same
_Hello World_ image without sudo:

```console
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
...
```

### macOS

For development build, the procedure is executed on the latest macOS
version (currently 10.13).

{% include note.html content="The procedure failed on macOS 10.15 and
was postponed to macOS 11.0, when some changes are expected anyway." %}

For production builds it is recommended to use a slightly older version.
macOS 10.10 is a good compromise.

It is not mandatory to have a physical macOS 10.10 machine, a virtual
machine is also perfectly fine. Both Parallels and VirtualBox were
checked and work without problems.

#### Install the Command Line Tools

The macOS compiler and other development tools are packed in a
separate Xcode add-on. The best place to get it is from the
[Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) site,
although this might require enrolling to the developer program
(free of charge).

The recommended way is to first install Xcode, then the Command Line Tools.

```console
$ xcode-select -p
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.13.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.4.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin
```

It is also possible to install the Command Line Tools separately
via a command line:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

{% include note.html content="In recent macOS versions it is
recommended to install only the CommandLineTools package." %}

#### Install Docker

On macOS, Docker can be installed by following the official
[Install Docker on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
instructions.

Due to the specifics of macOS, Docker cannot run native; instead,
it uses a GNU/Linux virtual machine running in Apple HyperKit
(Apple's virtualization framework).

For better results, dedicate 3-4 cores and 4-8 GB of RAM to Docker.

### Docker images

The Docker images are available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ilegeul/). They were build using
the Dockerfiles available from
[XBB (xPack Build Box)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box/tree/master/).

If not already loaded, Docker will load the images at first usage.
The images are relatively large, around 3-4 GB.

It is possible to separately load the Docker images, using the
script `preload-images` command of each script.

More details in each script documentation page.
