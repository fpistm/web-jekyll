## Overview

The **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** 
is an alternate binary distribution that complements the official 
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) 
maintained by ARM.

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure;
  the same procedure is used for all major 
  platforms (Windows 64/32-bit, GNU/Linux 64/32-bit, macOS);
- a convenient integration with Continuous Integration environments, 
  like Travis;
- a better integration with development environments 
  like **GNU MCU Eclipse**.

All binaries are self-contained, they include all required libraries,
and can be installed at any location.

## Compatibility

The **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC** is fully compatible with the 
original GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain distribution by ARM.

Occasionally, when bugs are discovered and the yearly ARM release schedule
would add unacceptably long delays, the **xPack GNU ARM Embedded GCC**
moves ahead of ARM and uses more recent tools versions that fix the bugs.
