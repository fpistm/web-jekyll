the correct forum.

## Check the documentation

and online from:

## Check the xPack Forums

Check the [xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for
similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Issues

Check the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Contribute to the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/),
and enter a **New Topic** in the CMake section.

## Register a new support ticket

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
distribution, not CMake itself (if you have doubts, use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the xPack CMake
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/issues/)
tracker.
