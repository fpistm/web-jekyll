## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the [xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/); please select the correct forum.

## Check the documentation

The xPack OpenOCD provides the original documentation in the
installed folders:

- `share/doc/pdf/openocd.pdf`

## Use the OpenOCD support channels

The xPack OpenOCD is only a binary distribution of the standard source code
OpenOCD, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing 
problems.

If you have problems related to the current OpenOCD functionality, please 
use the official OpenOCD [support channels](http://openocd.org/discussion/).

## Check the xPack Forums

Check the [xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for 
similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Issues

Check the GitHub Issues 
[tracker](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/) for 
similar problems.

## Contribute to the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use 
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have 
any experience that you want to share with others, use the 
[xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/), 
and enter a **New Topic** in the OpenOCD section.

## Register a new support ticket

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary 
distribution, not OpenOCD itself (if you have doubts, use the forum), 
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the xPack OpenOCD 
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the GitHub Issues 
[tracker](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/).
