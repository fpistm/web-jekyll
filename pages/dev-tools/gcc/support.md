installed folders:

## Check the GitHub issues

Check the

tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/),
and enter a **New Topic** in the **the xPack GNU Compiler Collection** section.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts,
use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack GNU Compiler Collection**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the

tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the forums**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the xPack forums**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.

the time more efficiently; since forum posts are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
