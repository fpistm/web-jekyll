## Check the Jekyll site

In a terminal, possibly inside Visual Studio Code, run a local server:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open the browser with [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) 
(or [http://127.0.0.1:4000/preview/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/preview/)).

Verify the changed pages.

## Add post to announce new release

- in `_posts/web/`
- add a new post named file like `2019-06-10-new-web-look.md`

## Publish site

With SourceTree:

- commit `xpack/xpack.github.io` (or `xpack/preview`)
- push

The site is automatically generated by Jekyll and published on GitHub Pages.
