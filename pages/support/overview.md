## Quicklinks

The best source for support is 
[The xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/); be sure you
select the right group/discussion.

## Tools issues

In case you encounter problems while using the xPack tools, please 
consider the following:

- read the documentation pages
- check the release pages for **Known issues**
  - [xpm releases](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/releases/)
- check the [forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for **FAQ**
- check the [forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for 
  discussions on similar subjects
- check the GitHub Issues trackers for the specific project
  - [xpm tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues/)

### Use the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use 
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have 
any experience that you want to share with others, please use the
[forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/), and be sure you
select the right group/discussion.

### Use the GitHub Issues trackers only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts, 
use the forums), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance 
the xPack tools, please use the specific GitHub Issues trackers:
- [xpm tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues/)

**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues for questions and support, use the forums.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, 
wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, 
you can fork and send a **Pull Request** for the 
[Web Source project](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io) 
or use the 
[Web Source Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io-source/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

Please, please, please: **do not use private e-mail for support**, 
since such messages will be automatically replied with a link to this page. 
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to efficiently use 
the time; since forum posts and GitHub Issues are archived, other people 
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
