## Mission statement

Provide a set of tools to manage, configure and build complex, package based, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain), intended to **enhance code sharing** and **reusing** during the life cycle of libraries and applications,
with an emphasis on C/C++ and embedded.

## xPacks overview

**xPacks** are general purpose software packages, much the same as the highly successful [npm modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) in the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/JavaScript ecosystem.

Based on the installed content, there are currently two 
types of xPacks: **source** and **binary**.

### Source xPacks

TBD

### Binary xPacks
